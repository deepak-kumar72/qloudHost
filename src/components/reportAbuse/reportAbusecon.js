        We are fighting against malware, phishing, botnets, and all the other
        forms of malicious attacks from the day of our establishment and have
        developed certain measures and technologies to help you protect and
        prevent against such kinds of threats as much as possible. In addition,
        we have also collaborated with some security companies, independent
        experts, law enforcement agencies to ensure stronger security against
        these threats.
